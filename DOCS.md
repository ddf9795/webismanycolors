As part of your submission, update this file with answers:

#### 1. What sort of story or experience are you conveying with your project?

As a part of this project, I am trying to make an alternate version of Frums' music video for their song "theyaremanycolors". While it is essentially impossible to recreate the effects used in the video using an audio visualizer, it is possible to make something that is somewhat representative of the experience of watching and listening to the video, but in a more traditional audio visualizer form factor.

#### 2. Which animation techniques did you use?

Alongside basic use of an audio visualizer, I used specific points in the song as key points to change the colors of the canvas and the way the visualizer is organized and drawn, to emulate the feeling of the original video with its erratic changes.

#### 3. What did you do for the "Beyond Baseline" requirement?

Alongside the automatic visualizer progression, I also added the ability for the user to manually override background color and visualizer type at will in an options submenu.
Also a little secret :)

#### 4. What gave you difficulty with this assignment?

CSS as usual, but I also had a hard time at first setting up the audio visualizer to work with a canvas. It eventually clicked though and I was just kinda dumb.

#### 5. What are you proud of with this assignment?

I am really proud of how the viewing experience feels so similar to the original video while still being unique and, to a degree, having a reason to watch this over the video. The timing and visualizer animations were really fun to come up with and create.
