# webismanycolors

A homework assignment for my IGME-330 Rich Media Web App Development course at RIT, dated late February 2024. Based by Frums' music video ["theyaremanycolors"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqyHAbUaaSQ), this project aimed to recreate the feel of the original music video in a web-based music visualizer. By default, the application automatically progresses through "stages," where the visualizer color and style changes to sync to the distinct sections of the song, but this can be disabled in the options to set up a custom, static visualizer combination.
